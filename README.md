# HackerRank 🚀

Welcome to my HackerRank Challenge Repository! 👨‍💻  
This repo is a collection of daily coding problems I solve on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) to improve my problem-solving and coding skills.
I started this journey from **basic-level** problems and aim to gradually solve **intermediate** and **difficult** level challenges using **JavaScript**.

## 📅 Daily Routine

- I solve **3 to 4 challenges per day**.
- Challenges are pushed to this GitHub repository daily.
- Problems span across various domains such as:
  - Data Structures
  - Algorithms
  - Mathematics
  - Strings
  - Recursion
  - SQL (optional)
  - And more...

## 🧠 Purpose
