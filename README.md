# 🚀 HackerRank Challenge Journey

Welcome to my **HackerRank Challenge Repository**! 👨‍💻  
This repo is a collection of **daily coding problems** I solve on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) to improve my problem-solving and coding skills.

I started from **basic-level challenges** and aim to gradually take on **intermediate** and **difficult** level problems using **JavaScript**.

## 📅 Daily Routine

🔁 I solve **3 to 4 challenges every day** and push the solutions to this repository.  
Each day's work is neatly organized into separate folders like `day1`, `day2`, ..., `day17` and so on.

> ✅ Consistency is key — practice every single day!
